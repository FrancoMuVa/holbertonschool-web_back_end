## Task - 0: The basics of async.

    Asynchronous coroutine that takes in an integer argument
    named wait_random that waits for a random delay between 0 and max_delay
    seconds and eventually returns it.


## Task - 1: Let's execute multiple coroutines at the same time with async.

    async routine called wait_n that takes in 2 int arguments n and max_delay.
    spawn wait_random n times with the specified max_delay.


## Task - 2: Measure the runtime.

    Function with integers n and max_delay as arguments that measures the
    total execution time for wait_n.


## Task - 3: Tasks.

    Function task_wait_random that takes an integer max_delay


## Task - 4: Tasks.

    async routine called task_wait_n that takes in 2 int
    arguments n and max_delay.
